## Description:
Blogger is a simple app used to make blog posts. Users can sign-up with their email and a username to begin. Users can create, edit and delete their posts, as well as comment on other user's blog posts. When finished, the user can log-out and come back at a later time to update the world on what other fantastic things they've been up to.
